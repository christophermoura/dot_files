Configure Multiple GIT Accounts on same Computer

Add the config file into ~/.ssh folder

Add this to your config file:

# Default GitHub user (DefaulUser)
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
 
# Other user (OtherUser)
Host github-other_user_name
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_other_user_name

Then add the 2nd key to your ssh keys by doing:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_other_user_name

*If you get error like "Could not authenticate agent." do this:
Open a git bash
exec ssh-agent bash
then use the ssh-add command
